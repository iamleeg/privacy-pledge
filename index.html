    <h1><a href="https://github.com/iamleeg/privacy-pledge">The App Makers' Privacy Pledge</a>
      </h1>


<p>We, the app makers who have signed our names to this pledge, value a long term relationship with customers who trust us over selling those same customers out to other companies for short term gains. We know the work that goes into making a magical experience in our apps, and we refuse to ruin our work and our customers' experience by causing people to worry over what is happening to their data. We value a world where our customers are in control of what they put into - and get out of - our apps, and trust us to enable and support that control. Therefore we resolve:</p>

<ul><li> To be clear about what information our apps need to provide the features we offer.</li>
<li> To only collect information required to implement our apps' features.</li>
<li> To allow our customers to opt in to only those features they are comfortable with; never to enable features that enable information-sharing without explicit agreement.</li>
<li> To allow our customers to review the information we have collected about them, and to delete information about a customer when that person requests it.</li>
<li> To present in clear language our relationships with other businesses, and the information we share as part of that relationship.</li></ul>

In short, our apps - not our customers - are our products.

Signed,
</p>
